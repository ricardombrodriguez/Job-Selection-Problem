# Job Selection Problem

Given T programming tasks, each one with a starting date, an ending date, and a profit, and given P programmers, the generalized weighted job selection problem asks for the best subset of programming tasks such that:
- the sum of the profits of the programming tasks belonging to the subset is maximized,
- each programming task is done by a single programmer, and
- each programmer cannot work on more than one task at a time.
Under the rules given above a programmer cannot interrupt a programming task to do another programming task; once she/he is commited to a programming task, she/he is busy until that task ends.
